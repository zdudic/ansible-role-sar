# Default vars for sar role

# This is host_group var. 
# Host group can be all hosts for a project, or similar use case for you. 
# Here we define default host group,
# since we can't expect that this var is defined in inventory or while running playbook

host_group: "default_host_group"

# Here we define default value for var sar_cfg. 
# Default is that sar will be configured on a host. 
# You can overwrite this to "no" in vars/main.yml, 
# maybe for some reason you want to skip sar config on a host/host-group 

# Supported values: 
# For positive: [Yy][Ee][Ss], Y, y 
# For negative: [Nn][Oo], N, n

default_host_group: 
  sar_cfg: "yes"
